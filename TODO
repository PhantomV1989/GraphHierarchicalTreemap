Links structure change to array of path nodes or dests. eg
    let links = [
        'srcA': [
            //path 1
            ['b','c','d',[ //branching at 4th node
                            'e','f' 
                        ]
            ],          

            //path 2
            ['q','w','y']
        ]
    ]

Remove g- groups
Pathing optimization, reuse existing paths as much as possible(till closest node to dst, then draw new paths)
Setup proper build scripts
